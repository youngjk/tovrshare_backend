# Tovrshare Backend

We run a Node.js app backed by [Express 4](http://expressjs.com/).

## Running Locally

Make sure you have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and npm installed.

1. `cd` into your working directory.
2. First things first, you need to install the dependencies. Run `npm install`
3. `npm start` to start running the server. 

## Documentation

We use Swagger UI to display our documentation. Once the server is deployed, this is accessible at the `/docs` endpoint.

### TODO: Make this debug only. On production environments, this should not be visible to others.
